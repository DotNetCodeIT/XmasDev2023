# Ambushing Babbo Natale?
**Room:** Track Panettone

**Start Time:** 2023-12-15 14:40

Now you have technology, you look all night at the security cameras. But still staying up all night, some things do not change.
How about to put technology to look at security cameras and identify Babbo Natale and notify us and catch him, at last?
So, this session will help you, if you hurry, using the latest and greatest that Microsoft (Azure) has to offer, to get Babbo at last red handed, putting the presents under the tree.
Will have Kinder chocolates, Azure Cognitive Services, KAN, and will create an end-to-end Custom Vision Solution during the session, sound almost as fun as the presents under the tree ðŸ˜Š
